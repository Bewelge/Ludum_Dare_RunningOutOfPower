      Keep the Earth alive as long as possible! 
    </br> Use Your mouse to rotate the Sun around the Earth (or Earth around the Sun). Every time You make a (clockwise) Rotation, one day passes and You will gain some Energy. 
    </br> Don't go too close to the sun or the Earth will burn!
    </br> But don't let it get too far away or humanity will freeze!
    </br> Also don't let the earth get hit by the meteors! Use the sun instead to burn them all down!
    </br> You can click to transfer some Energy into HP if You're running low!
    </br> Have Fun!

      This game was made as part of the Ludum Dare 39 Compo.
    </br>Everything was made by Benjamin Welge during the weekend of the competition although I did use some javascript snippets from previous projects (Mainly for collision and some of the effects like the lightning).
    </br> It was my first time participating and also the first time I tried my hand at creating Music/sounds for a game. The three .wav's were made using Beepbox.co, and I vehemently apologize for the annoyingness of the main sound. I really hope the Mute button works in all Browsers ;-)
</br>
    Would appreciate any feedback, criticism or comments You might have!</br>
    Have Fun!
